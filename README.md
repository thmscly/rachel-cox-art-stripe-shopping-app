This is an e-commerce web app to showcase and sell the artwork of Rachel Cox.

It's built using Laravel 9 as a back-end structure with React on the client side.

It's also utilizing Stripe as a payment processor.

To run:

In 2 separate terminals:
Terminal 1: `php arisan serve`
Terminal 2: `npm install && npm run dev`

Obviously, some Stripe information is sensitive, so will be housed in a gitignored .env file, but, as an in-progress portfolio web app, PRs are welcome.
